📊 Data Analysis & Data Science Project – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Sales Performance Analysis
📌 Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Sales Performance Analysis using Python. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize sales data to uncover key insights, detect patterns, and build a predictive model for sales forecasting.

🔍 Key Objectives
✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding trends, distributions, and correlations
✔ Data Visualization – Using Matplotlib & Seaborn for effective insights
✔ Predictive Modeling – Training a Linear Regression Model to predict sales
✔ Business Insights & Recommendations – Identifying factors affecting sales performance

📂 Dataset Information
Columns: Product, Region, Sales, Profit, Discount, Category, Date
Size: 1000 rows (synthetically generated for analysis)
Format: CSV
🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
✅ Python – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
✅ Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for execution
✅ Machine Learning – Linear Regression for Sales Prediction

📈 Key Insights from Analysis
📊 Sales Distribution: Sales vary significantly across regions and categories
📌 Profit vs. Discount: Higher discounts don’t always lead to higher profits
📉 Trends & Forecasting: A linear model can help estimate future sales based on past trends

🚀 Results & Deliverables
📄 EDA Report – Summary of findings, trends, and anomalies
📊 Visualizations – Histograms, Boxplots, Scatter Plots, and Heatmaps
🤖 Predictive Model – Trained Linear Regression Model for Sales Forecasting

📢 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can help businesses make informed decisions about sales strategies, discount policies, and regional performance.
